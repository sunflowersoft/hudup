Dear Researcher/Scholar/Professor/Scientist,
Your expertise in science is appreciated very much.
I kindly invite you to join the group "Adaptation and Personalization".

Adaptation is ability of a given system to change its actions to deal with different situations. Personalization is ability of a given system that allows users to customize itself according to their preferences. Both adaptation and personalization aim to serve and support users in the best way. This is the new trend of modern technologies and products in which user is the center. There are many fundamental researches and practical techniques focusing on adaptation and personalization, such as adaptive system, collaborative filtering, and user modeling.

As member of this group, you are encouraged in sharing your professional knowledge and experiences, submitting your manuscripts, enjoying new articles and book, etc. Moreover you are warmly invited to review other members' articles as a reviewer/editor.

Your knowledge, experiences, and contributions are very important and necessary for our group to be successful.
