Comments to the Author: 
Overall, the technical contribution of the paper is quite limited, and the presentation of the paper can be improved. 
1.	In the introduction part (Section 1), the author gave a brief introduction to collaborative filtering, but did not clearly state the contribution of the paper. 
2.	In the technical part (Section 2), the author described the solution, but there is no intuitive explanation of the motivation of the algorithm and the challenges it targets to address. 
3.	The evaluation of the approach is weak: the authors should compare with state-of-the-arts methods.
