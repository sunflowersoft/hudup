DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY IS A LEADING VENUE FOR ARCHIVAL PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH IN THE DISCIPLINES OF DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY.  PAPERS SHOULD BE ASSESSED AGAINST HIGH STANDARDS OF SCHOLARSHIP, PRESENTATION AND EXPECTED IMPACT.



SUMMARY. PROVIDE A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE REASONS FOR YOUR RECOMMENDATION. WHAT ARE THE MAJOR STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE MANUSCRIPT?

The paper presents a personal point of view about Recommender Systems (RS). From a general description of RS and their classification, the author describes a new proposal based on the discovery of frequent item sets.

The algorithmic proposal in quite detailed and do not use any previous algorithm in any part of the proposed method. However, there are many options in the literature that the paper does not consider.

In fact, there is not a properly description of the state of the art. There is no identification of flaws in available RS.

Reviewer #2: DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY REVIEW FORM:

DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY IS A LEADING VENUE FOR ARCHIVAL PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH IN THE DISCIPLINES OF DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY.  PAPERS SHOULD BE ASSESSED AGAINST HIGH STANDARDS OF SCHOLARSHIP, PRESENTATION AND EXPECTED IMPACT.



SUMMARY. PROVIDE A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE REASONS FOR YOUR RECOMMENDATION. WHAT ARE THE MAJOR STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE MANUSCRIPT?

The paper describes an approach to collaborative filtering based on frequent itemset mining. In short, the contribution can be summarized as follows:
- An algorithm for mining frequent itemsets is introduced.
- New items (and relative ratings) can be recommended to the user by looking at the current history. If any frequent itemset is found which partially matches the user's history, then the mismatches can be exploited for recommendation.

STRONG POINTS:

- Simple idea, apparently effective

WEAK POINT:

- extremely poorly written
- several inconsistencies in the formal framework
- experimental setup not fully explained
- A comparison with the (HUGE) state of the art is totally ignored


RELEVANCE. HOW RELEVANT IS THE PAPER TO THE DISCIPLINES OF DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY?

The paper is relevant.


SIGNIFICANCE. HOW SIGNIFICANTLY DOES THE PAPER ADVANCE THE CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART? HOW BIG AN IMPACT WILL THE PAPER HAVE, ON WHAT AREAS, AND WHY?  WILL THE PAPER STIMULATE FURTHER RESEARCH?

The paper is of little significance. First, there are several algorithms for mining frequent item sets. Why should we need yet another algorithm is not explained. In particular, the algorithm (as stated by the same author) does not seem complete. I have to admit I was not able to understand how the algorithm work: the english is very poor, and the general idea is a little bit obscure. Hence, I'm not sure the algorithm is correct at all.



RELATED RESEARCH.  IS ALL RELEVANT PRIOR WORK DISCUSSED? IS THE CURRENT WORK A DISTINCT AND NEW CONTRIBUTION RELATIVE TO THE AUTHOR(S)' PREVIOUS WORK?  [NOTE, ECMLPKDD TRACK DOES NOT CONSIDER EXPANDED VERSIONS OF WORK PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED IN CONFERENCES OR WORKSHOPS.]

The recent state of the art is totally ignored, both on the collaborative filtering topic, and on the frequent itemset mining problem. There are several approaches, even naive ones, which should be taken into account. Relying solely on item-based or user-based approaches, without mentioning a reference is not enough. Besides, There are several improvements of the SVD technique which should be considered.

RELATIONSHIP TO PREVIOUS RESEARCH. IS THE NOVEL CONTRIBUTION OF THE NEW WORK MADE EXPLICIT TOGETHER WITH ITS RELATIONSHIP TO PRIOR WORK?  IS THE NEED FOR THE NEW CONTRIBUTION SUBSTANTIATED?  DOES THE PAPER MAKE CLEAR NOT ONLY THE STRENGTH BUT ALSO THE LIMITATIONS OF THE NEW CONTRIBUTION?



No.

THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION. IS THE THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION SOUND AND APPROPRIATE. ARE ALL CLAIMS THAT ARE MADE BACKED BY SUFFICIENT THEORETICAL OR EXPERIMENTAL SUPPORT? IS APPROPRIATE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PROVIDED OF EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS AND ARE APPROPRIATE CONCLUSIONS DRAWN?



The experimental part tells little about the experimental setting. First of all, one would like to know if the dataset was preprocessed somehow. Further, did the author split into training/test. Are the results cross-validated?
Finally, there's no mention to the Item-based/user-based techniques. A reference would be appropriate, or even a short description of the algorithms employed. Finally, the paper should describe in greater details the evaluation methodology, and how it is related to the collaborative filtering algorithm. In fact, since frequent patterns represent local methods, there is no guarantee that the rating matrix can be completed. Hence the question: how do you handle cases where the algorithm does not provide a rating for the test set, if any?

IS THE ENGLISH EXPRESSION OF A SUITABLE STANDARD FOR PUBLICATION?  IS THE PAPER OF APPROPRIATE LENGTH? IF NOT, WHAT SHOULD BE ADDED, EXPANDED, DELETED OR COMPRESSED? DO THE TITLE AND ABSTRACT APPROPRIATELY REFLECT THE CONTENTS?

This is the weakest part of the paper. The english is rather poor and clearly below the standards for publication.



TECHNICAL DETAIL.  IS SUFFICIENT DETAIL PROVIDED ABOUT ALGORITHMS AND TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES?  IS THERE SUFFICIENT DETAIL TO ALLOW REPLICATION OF THE WORK?



The description of the algorithm is extremely poor. I have the impression that the author does not properly use the bit operators AND, OR and NOT. For example: page 7, line 26: b is likely to be all zeros. The required operation seems more like an OR.


FIGURES AND TABLES.  ARE THE FIGURES AND TABLES NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT?


REFERENCES.  ARE THE REFERENCES ACCURATE AND COMPLETE?

Reviewer #3: DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY REVIEW FORM:

DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY IS A LEADING VENUE FOR ARCHIVAL PUBLICATION OF RESEARCH IN THE DISCIPLINES OF DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY.  PAPERS SHOULD BE ASSESSED AGAINST HIGH STANDARDS OF SCHOLARSHIP, PRESENTATION AND EXPECTED IMPACT.



SUMMARY. PROVIDE A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE REASONS FOR YOUR RECOMMENDATION. WHAT ARE THE MAJOR STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE MANUSCRIPT?

According to the author, the manuscript proposes a recommendation algorithm that uses a collaborative filtering technique based on mining frequent itemsets. Actually, in essence, the manuscript proposes to pre-process (discretize) the ratings from a dataset; then, the frequent itemsets are mined; and finally, to provide the recommendations, the itemsets are binarized in order to facilitate the matching between itemsets and the items from the current active user. The proposal is not so innovative and the new contributions are limitated. Besides, the manuscript needs lots of improvements. For example, the proposal should be better motivated and described. The author does not present any related work and he does not discuss his proposal against other similar works proposed in the literature. The evaluation is very short and it is not enough to evaluate the merits of the proposal. The English expression is not suitable for publication.


RELEVANCE. HOW RELEVANT IS THE PAPER TO THE DISCIPLINES OF DATA MINING AND KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY?

The manuscript is marginally relevant (contributions are limitated) to the disciplines of data mining and knowledge discovery.


SIGNIFICANCE. HOW SIGNIFICANTLY DOES THE PAPER ADVANCE THE CURRENT STATE-OF-THE-ART? HOW BIG AN IMPACT WILL THE PAPER HAVE, ON WHAT AREAS, AND WHY?  WILL THE PAPER STIMULATE FURTHER RESEARCH?

The manuscript provides a marginal advance of the current state-of-the-art and the impact on the recommender system area is small. Besides, I believe that this manuscript will not stimulate further research.


RELATED RESEARCH.  IS ALL RELEVANT PRIOR WORK DISCUSSED? IS THE CURRENT WORK A DISTINCT AND NEW CONTRIBUTION RELATIVE TO THE AUTHOR(S)' PREVIOUS WORK?  [NOTE, ECMLPKDD TRACK DOES NOT CONSIDER EXPANDED VERSIONS OF WORK PREVIOUSLY PUBLISHED IN CONFERENCES OR WORKSHOPS.]

[NOTE, DMKD CLOSELY SCRUTINIZES ANY SUGGESTION BY A REVIEWER THAT THEIR OWN WORK SHOULD BE REFERENCED AND RESERVES THE RIGHT TO DELETE ANY SUCH COMMENTS FROM A REVIEW. WHERE A REVIEWER BELIEVES THEIR OWN WORK SHOULD BE CITED,WE ADVISE WRITING A COMMENT TO THE EDITORS UNDER CONFIDENTIAL COMMENTS TO THE EDITOR.]

The author does not present/discuss any related work. Therefore, it is difficult to identify new contributions relative to author's previous work or any other related work.


RELATIONSHIP TO PREVIOUS RESEARCH. IS THE NOVEL CONTRIBUTION OF THE NEW WORK MADE EXPLICIT TOGETHER WITH ITS RELATIONSHIP TO PRIOR WORK?  IS THE NEED FOR THE NEW CONTRIBUTION SUBSTANTIATED?  DOES THE PAPER MAKE CLEAR NOT ONLY THE STRENGTH BUT ALSO THE LIMITATIONS OF THE NEW CONTRIBUTION?

The author does not describe the advantages/limitations of his proposal with respect to prior works. As already stated, the author does not present any related work. Besides, the author does not present the needs for its proposal, and more information about the strengths and limitations of his proposal is needed in the manuscript.


THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION. IS THE THEORETICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION SOUND AND APPROPRIATE. ARE ALL CLAIMS THAT ARE MADE BACKED BY SUFFICIENT THEORETICAL OR EXPERIMENTAL SUPPORT? IS APPROPRIATE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PROVIDED OF EXPERIMENTAL
RESULTS AND ARE APPROPRIATE CONCLUSIONS DRAWN?

The evaluation needs to be extended in terms of datasets, discussion, statistical analysis and so on. The current evaluation does not provide enough evidences about the conclusions presented in the manuscript.
- The algorithm is built upon Hudup - A framework of e-commercial recommendation algorithms. The complex evaluation mechanism inside Hudup goes beyond this paper.

EXPRESSION. IS THE PAPER CLEARLY WRITTEN AND ACCESSIBLE TO A WIDE AUDIENCE OF DATA MINING RESEARCHERS?  IF NOT, WHAT TYPES OF CHANGES ARE REQUIRED? IS THE ENGLISH EXPRESSION OF A SUITABLE STANDARD FOR PUBLICATION?  IS THE PAPER OF APPROPRIATE LENGTH? IF NOT, WHAT SHOULD BE ADDED, EXPANDED, DELETED OR COMPRESSED? DO THE TITLE AND ABSTRACT APPROPRIATELY REFLECT THE CONTENTS?

The manuscript needs a new organization of its sections in order to be accessible to a wide audience. Additionally, it should also be reviewed by a native English speaker. The English expression is not suitable for publication and makes the manuscript not so clear.


TECHNICAL DETAIL.  IS SUFFICIENT DETAIL PROVIDED ABOUT ALGORITHMS AND TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING EXPERIMENTAL TECHNIQUES?  IS THERE SUFFICIENT DETAIL TO ALLOW REPLICATION OF THE WORK?

The manuscript does not provide sufficient details. For example, the author only presents the pseudo-code for the algorithms. He does not describe them in details. The proposed technique should be illustrated in a figure, for example, and better described in the manuscript. The current version of the manuscript does not allow the replication of the work.


FIGURES AND TABLES.  ARE THE FIGURES AND TABLES NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT?

The tables are not setup appropriately. On the other hand, the manuscript does not present any figure. The authors should present figures, in particular, for the evaluation section in order to emphasize the experimental results.


REFERENCES.  ARE THE REFERENCES ACCURATE AND COMPLETE?

The manuscript should present more references related to the author's proposal. The author only presents five references and some of them are not complete.


AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW, ECMLPKDD JOURNAL TRACK IS RUNNING IN TWO JOUNRALS: DMKD AND MACHINE LEARNING. TOPIC-WISE, WHICH JOURNAL, DMKD OR MACHINE LEARNING, WOULD BE A BETTER FIT FOR THIS PAPER?

A better fit for this manuscript would be the DMKD journal.
