Dear Sir/Madam
I am very interested in RecSys Tutorial 2016.
This is a big chance for me to enhance research career.
Moreover I desire to contribute to science. This is my biggest honor and happiness.

I am Loc Nguyen, founder of Sunflower Soft Company, who submit a proposal of "Hudup â€“ A Framework of E-commercial Recommendation Algorithms" to RecSys Tutorial 2016.

Recommendation algorithm is very important to e-commercial websites when it can provide favorite products to online customers, which results out an increase in sale revenue. I propose the infrastructure for e-commercial recommendation solutions. It is a middleware framework of e-commercial recommendation software, which supports scientists and software developers to build up their own recommendation algorithms with low cost, high achievement and fast speed.

The attached includes the tutorial proposal of Hudup.
Best regards,
